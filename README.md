# AutoSleepScorer
A pilot project to create a robust sleep scorer using Convolutional Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory. 
It is a follow-up of my Master's Thesis: [Automatic Sleep Stage Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory](https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer/blob/master/figures/thesis.pdf?raw=true)

**This package was a pilot project and is no longer being developed (as of 2017). There is no clinical validation and no support**

The package is experimental at least. Please do not use this package in clinical or research setup. The pretrained weights supplied at the moment are random snapshots of one of the trainings of the CCSHS50 dataset and are only for demonstrational purposes. The final goal is to have weights trained on different datasets, but I have not had time so far, and probably will never have.

### Other good projects

As the project continues to get attention, I encourage you to take a look at newer project instead of my project, especially

* [U-Sleep](https://github.com/perslev/U-Sleep) and [U-Time](https://github.com/perslev/U-Time)
   * it performs amazingly well, much much better than anything I've seen before! Seal of approval from my side :)
   * check out [sleepyland](https://github.com/biomedical-signal-processing/SLEEPYLAND) for some readily trained models
* [YASA](https://github.com/raphaelvallat/yasa) not quite as good as U-Sleep, but open source and with accessible models.
* [TinySleepNet](https://github.com/akaraspt/tinysleepnet) much better theoretical ground work than AutoSleepScorer, and using newer paradigms



## Introduction

![Sample Hypnogram](https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer/blob/master/figures/hypno.png?raw=true)

In this project a Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory is used for the detection of sleep stages. This approach has the advantage that it can automatically detect and extract features from the raw EEG, EMG and EOG signal (see [here](https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer/blob/master/figures/features.png?raw=true) for example features that are learned by the network). The network architecture was trained and evaluated on several different public and private datasets to ensure a good generalizability (CCSHS, EDFx, EMSA). The network architecture can be found [here](https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer/blob/master/figures/architecture.png?raw=true).

Currently the classifier reaches the state-of-the-art of automatic sleep stage classification while obtaining a similar performance to a human scorer. Further results and details on the architecture are available in my [Thesis](https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer/blob/master/figures/thesis.pdf?raw=true)

## Usage

The Classifier expects a PSG recording with at least one EEG, EMG and EOG present. Theoretically all data formats supported by [MNE](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/python_reference.html#reading-raw-data) can be used, or any numpy data in the format [epochs, 3000, 3]. All data will be resampled to 100 Hz.

Documentation and command line instructions are coming soon. For now please see [Quickstart](https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer#quickstart).


## Installation
The AutoSleepScorer is currently running with Python 3 using Keras with Tensorflow and has been tested on Windows 10. Due to Pythons multi-platform support it should run other OS as well. The easiest way to get started is using Anaconda, a Python package manager.

### 1. Install Anaconda
Download and install Anaconda with Python 3.6 64 bit from https://www.anaconda.com/download/#download

If you already have a working Python 3.x environment you can skip this step.

### 2. Install Tensorflow
Open a command line and install tensorflow via `pip install tensorflow`

If you wish to have GPU support with a GeForce graphics card and have installed CUDA you can use `pip install tensorflow-gpu`. Running calculations on the GPU accelerates them significantly.
Installation of CUDA can be a bit tricky and is described here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

### 3. Install AutoSleepScorer
Clone and install this repository via pip:
`pip install git+https://github.com/skjerns/AutoSleepScorer`

If you get an error that`git` is not installed, you can install it using the command line `conda install git`

# Quickstart

Open a python console for instance using Anaconda.

## **Minimal example**

For quick classification

```Python
from sleepscorer import Scorer
file = "eeg_filename" #link to the EEG header or EEG file
scorer = Scorer([file], hypnograms=True)
scorer.run()
```

## **Extended example**

First we download a sample file from the EDFx database

```Python
from sleepscorer import tools
# download sample EEG file from the EDFx database
tools.download('https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/sleep-edfx/sleep-cassette/SC4001E0-PSG.edf', 'sample-psg.edf')
# download corresponding hypnogram for comparrison of classification
tools.download('https://pastebin.com/raw/jbzz16wP', 'sample-psg.groundtruth.csv') 
```
Now we can start the Scorer using a list of EEG files.
Instead of an EEG-filename we can also set advanced options using a `SleepData` object
```Python
# create a SleepData object 
from sleepscorer import Scorer, SleepData
file = SleepData('sample-psg.edf', start = 2880000, stop = 5400000, 
							  channels={'EEG':'EEG Fpz-Cz', 'EMG':'EMG submental', 
                              			'EOG':'EOG horizontal'}, preload=False)
# Create and run Scorer
scorer = Scorer([file], hypnograms=True, demo=True)
scorer.run()
# this will only work if you have matplotlib set-up
tools.show_sample_hypnogram('sample-psg.groundtruth.csv', start=960, stop=1800)
```
The predictions will now be saved as `sample-psg.edf.csv`, where each row corresponds to one epoch (0=W, 1=S1, 2=S2, 3=SWS, 4=REM).

## **Extended using numpy arrays**
If you want to handle the data loading yourself you can do so. Data needs to be sampled with 100 Hz. EEG and EOG are high-pass filtered with 0.15 Hz and the EMG has a high-pass filter of 10 Hz. Data needs to be in the format `[epochs, 3000, 3]` where the last dimension is EEG, EMG and EOG.

```Python
from sleepscorer import Classifier
data = ... # load your python array, preprocessed
assert(data.ndim==3 and data.shape[1:]==(3000,3))

clf = Classifier()
clf.download_weights()  # skip this if you already downloaded them.
clf.load_cnn_model('./weights/cnn.hdf5')
clf.load_rnn_model('./weights/rnn.hdf5)
preds = clf.predict(data, classes=True)
```
